This project involves the creation of an interactive dashboard in Tableau that visualizes AirBnB sales data. The dashboard provides insights into the number of rooms available, their average prices, and sales trends, all segmented by ZIP Code. This tool is designed to help stakeholders understand the distribution and pricing of AirBnB properties across various regions.

## Key Features

- **Sales Visualization**: Displays total sales across different ZIP Codes, offering a clear view of AirBnB performance by region.
- **Room Availability**: Highlights the number of rooms available in each ZIP Code, providing an understanding of market supply.
- **Average Price Analysis**: Visualizes the average price of rooms in various ZIP Codes, allowing for price comparison and market analysis.
- **Data Trends**: Includes time-based visualizations to track changes in sales and pricing over time.

## Technologies Used

- **Tableau**: Used for data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **CSV/Excel**: Data sources for importing AirBnB sales and room availability information.
